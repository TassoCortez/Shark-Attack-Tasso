# Shark-Attack-Tasso



Project objectives: 
Answer 2 main questions: 
 - How deadly shark attacks really are.
 - Are shark attacks increasing over time?
Correlation between the 2 previous questions.


Milestones:
	To achieve the most accurate information from the database, the first step is to make the information as reliable as possible.
	The initial file had almost 85% rows that didn't have 10% of the columns completed.  The first step was to remove these rows and 2 columns that had no important information.
	After performing this 2 major cleans in the database, i was able to perform a deep clear on almost every value that was not as expected.

Analyzing the data:
	The increase of shark attacks are clear, but the lethality not so much. Even with a huge increase in the number of attacks, the lethality didn't increase as expected.
The highest number of lethal victims took place in the 1960’s, where the number of attacks is much lower than in the 2000’s. 


Conclusion: 
	After evaluating the number it is clearer that the chance of being attacked by a shark is very remote, and  the chance of been killed by one is even more remote.
Now thinking further and stimulating a little bit our creativity, it is possible to conclude that sharks have realized that humans are a reliable source of food and not killing their prey, they can guarantee a never ending supply of human flesh for their future generations.
